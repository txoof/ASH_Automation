# ASH SIS Automation

Automation plugins and scripts for ASH PowerSchool SIS.

## Overview

PowerSchool SIS generates reports on a schedule set in the Data Export Manager (*Functions > Importing & Exporting > Data Export Manager*). Reports are transmitted to an internal SSH host (see [internal documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JPArXP_7C58uMpqMbwHHK_5DDGpmmQw2)).

Documents deposited on the SSH host are processed and forwarded on to the appropriate user groups with links to documentation and instructions particular to the document. All documents should only be mailed to google group addresses within the domain. Distribution lists are maintained exclusively through the google groups.

Reports are produced through PowerSchool PowerQueries. For more information on updating and maintaining the PowerQuery reports see the [sis_automation README](./sis_automation/README.md) in this repository.

## Report setup

Create a report using the Data Export Manager to choose using the appropriate `com.txoof.ashautomation` named query (NQ). When done make sure to save the template.

* recipient: google group that will receive the report
* delimiter: always `-_-`
* file name: name of report that will be appened to the email
* date shortcut: always `%d`
  * the Data Export Manager will substitute the current date when running scheduled jobs.
* file suffix: always `.csv`

## Email setup

Email is forwarded from the SSH host to a google group. The forwarding address is contained within the report name. See the [Group Naming Convention](#group-naming-convention) below.

To help prevent malicious data exfiltration from the SIS to external email addresses, reports will only be forwarded to email addresses that follow the format `recipient_sis_reports@host.com`. `_sis_reports@host.com` are set in the in the variable `email_group_suffix` in the [`parse_ps_reports.sh`](./parse_ps_reports/parse_ps_reports.sh) script.

Google groups in the domain are configured so only Google admins can create groups that match the pattern below. All other groups generated by users are set to *group_name*_**group@ash.nl**

### Google Groups Settings

Google groups must be created by a domain administrator from the [Google Admin Groups Console](https://admin.google.com/ac/groups). Use the settings below when creating a new group for use with automation.

#### General

* *Group name*: ASH *Name Of Group*
  * Use a descriptive name that indicates the purpose of the group
* *Group Email*: *group_name*_**sis_reports@ash.nl** 
  * See [Group Naming Convention](#group-naming-convention) below
* *Group description*: add link to this documentation (https://github.com/txoof/ASH_Automation)

### Debian Packages

## Report setup

Report names need to be formatted as `destination_group-_-report_name.csv`. The `destination_group` must match a google group in the form of `destination_group_sis_reports@ash.nl`. The delimiter between the destination group and the report name must always be `-_-`. 
## Email setup

All outgoing emails will get `sis_textbody/default_body.txt` appended to the email.

Specific text will be added to outgoing email.
